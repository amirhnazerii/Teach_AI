## Get large file from google drive:
1- install gdown by:
pip install gdown

2- After that, you can download any file from Google Drive by running one of these commands:

gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=<file_id>  # for files
gdown <file_id>                                 # alternative format
gdown --folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<file_id>  # for folders
gdown --folder --id <file_id>                                   # this format works for folders too
Example: to download the readme file from this directory

gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B7EVK8r0v71pOXBhSUdJWU1MYUk
The file_id should look something like 0Bz8a_Dbh9QhbNU3SGlFaDg. You can find this ID by right-clicking on the file of interest, and selecting Get link. As of November 2021, this link will be of the form:

# Files
https://drive.google.com/file/d/<file_id>/view?usp=sharing
# Folders
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<file_id>
